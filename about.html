        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Great design is more than creating things that are visually appealing; it requires a solid understanding of human behavior and what they want. <br /> <br />From customer service to sales; and from marketing to project management, the roles
          throughout my professional career have had the same attribute connect them: the need to understand what my clients want. In sales and marketing, I was able to obtain important skills to understand clients&rsquo; behavior and market trends
          to determine how to boast sales. In project management, I was able to adopt to a more analytical approach to my problems and obtain skills that are crucial working in a team setting. <br /> <br />I began my transition to UX design by
          proactively taking more responsibilities in digital content creation/management. To further develop my skills in UX design, I completed a UX design bootcamp from CareerFoundry where I was able to practice what I have learned and turned
          ideas into reality by building Vocab Building Expert and Surfing You.</p>
